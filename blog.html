                         <p class = "postText">I had some basic HTML skills from previously teaching myself, so i foudn this assignment very easy. I just used the review from class and was able to quickly build this site. One issue i ran into was sizing the image without the use of CSS. I ended up having to edit it outside so that it was the right orientation and then set the height in the image tag. </p>

                         <h3 class = "title"> Assignment #2 (4/23/2018)</h3>
                         <p class = "postText">I ran into trouble with flex boxes while trying to make the website dynamic. Getting these boxes to size equally and in a way took some experimenting. Another issue was with the icon in the twit itself. I ended up making the height of the icon 100% so that the text didnt wrap underneath it. I learned how to adjust boarders, margins, and padding. I ended up using w3schools.com as a refrences for a lot of command variables. I knew a lot about structuring divs but i didnt know the diffrences between classes and ID's. Overall i enjoyed the assignment and learned a lot about styling pages. </p>
